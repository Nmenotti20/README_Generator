### Project Description

This project creates a command line application that dynamically creates a template for producing a quality README.md file by prompting the user for input used to generate the file content.

#### User Story

In order to be able to focus more of my time on developing, I want to have a README Generator populate and format quality README.md files for my projects.

### Installation

node index.js
  
### Usage

Navigate via command-line to the index.js file. From the command-line, input the command "node index.js" and the command-line will prompt you with a series of questions to complete which will be used to generate and fill in your professional README.md file for your project when the questions are completed with the user's input. Your generated README.md will generate to the OUTPUT.md file.
