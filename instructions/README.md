### Project Description
  
This project creates a command line application that dynamically creates a template for producing a quality README.md file by prompting the user for input used to generate the file content.

#### User Story
  
In order to be able to focus more of my time on developing, I want to have a README Generator populate and format quality README.md files for my projects.
  
### Installation
  
node index.js
### Usage

Navigate via command-line to the index.js file. From the command-line, input the command "node index.js" and the command-line will prompt you with a series of questions to complete which will be used to generate and fill in your professional README.md file for your project when the questions are completed with the user's input.
